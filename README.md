Revision of JS that I did earlier in 2024.

## JavaScript Revision: Data Types, Operators, and Conditional Statements
This file contains a revision of core JavaScript concepts, including data types, operators, and control flow. It serves as a practice file for revisiting fundamental JavaScript logic and syntax.

## Key Topics Covered

## Data Types
String: Demonstrating single and double quotes for defining strings (firstName = "Elon";).
Number: Handling both integer and floating-point numbers.
Boolean: Examples of true/false values and comparison operations.
Undefined: A variable declared but not yet initialized.
Null: A deliberate assignment to represent "no value."
Object: A basic object structure with properties (person object).
Array: Defining and logging arrays.

## Functions
A simple example of a function that logs a message to the console.

## Operators
Arithmetic Operators: Demonstrating addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
Comparison Operators: Exploring ==, ===, and relational operators.
Logical Operators: Usage of AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!) operators.
String Operators: Concatenation with + and compound operators like +=.

## Control Flow
If-Else Statements: Basic conditional statements with multiple branches.
Switch Statements: Handling multiple possible conditions with a case-based structure.
Ternary Operator: A concise way to handle simple conditional logic.
